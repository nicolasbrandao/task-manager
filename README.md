## Model
The TaskDAO class provides methods for interacting with task data in a consistent and organized manner. It serves as the Model component in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for the project. This class allows you to manage tasks stored in the database with clear CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Create `create(task)`
Creates a new task in the database.

`task (object): An object representing the task to be created. It should contain title (string) and description (string) properties.`
- Usage
```
const newTask = {
  title: "Task Title",
  description: "Task Description",
};

await task.create(newTask);
```
### Search `search(searchTerm)`
Searches for tasks in the database that match the provided search term and returns an array of tasks that match the search criteria.

`searchTerm (string): The search term to be used for filtering tasks.`

- Usage
```
const searchTerm = "search term";
const searchResults = await task.search(searchTerm);
```

### Update `update(updatedTask)`
Updates an existing task in the database.

`updatedTask (object): An object representing the updated task. It should contain id (string), title (string), and description (string) properties.`

- Usage
```
const updatedTask = {
  id: "task-id",
  title: "Updated Task Title",
  description: "Updated Task Description",
};

await task.update(updatedTask);
```

### Delete `delete(id)`
Deletes a task from the database.

`id (string): The ID of the task to be deleted.`
- Usage
```
const taskIdToDelete = "task-id-to-delete";
await task.delete(taskIdToDelete);
```
